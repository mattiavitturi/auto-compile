Auto Compile
============
Auto compiler for lazy people, like me.

## Requirements
_C code obviously_

## Installation
You should know how to run a bash script... ðŸ˜‘

## Usage
```auto-compile src-file-no-ext [-r]```
- __-r__: rebuilds code at start (by default, it doesn't compile with no file changes)
